      <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
      </br>
      <p>The Paideia Institute (PI) aims to promote the study of the humanities through educational programming in Europe. By ‘humanistic’ PI understands not only the material that is taught, namely those academic disciplines which study the productions of human culture in distinction from the natural or social sciences, but also how that material is presented. PI programs are administered according to the following principles:
      </p>
      </br>
      
      <h2>Pedagogical Philosophy</h2>
      </br>
      <p>PI seeks to offer programs that add a dynamic, experiential element to traditional humanistic education by stressing human interaction and the give and take between individuals. PI sees that the most effective learning occurs within a pedagogical atmosphere based in close personal friendship and a mentoring relationship between teacher and student. PI instructors are therefore encouraged to foster this type of relationship with PI program participants and are hired based on a demonstrated ability and willingness to do so.
      </p>
      </br>
	    
      <h2>Evaluation</h2>
      </br>
      <p>PI does not grade its students or offer university credit for its courses. In the most effective learning environment, participants are motivated to learn because of their own inherent interest in the material and because of the commitment of their peers and instructors. PI contends that grading prevents participants from taking the risks that are necessary for learning. PI will communicate with universities about its programs and otherwise collaborate if participants wish to seek credit on their own.
      </p>
      </br>
		  
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      </br>
      <p>PI programs embrace all disciplines of humanistic study. PI especially pursues programming designed to enhance cultural understanding through the interactive study of European history, language, literature, and art. It strives to provide programming that supplements the typical American university curriculum by focusing its programs on neglected or understudied aspects of a given humanistic field. For example, in its Latin courses PI exposes participants to Medieval and Renaissance Latin texts in addition to the Classical Latin authors that form the basis of Classics programs at American universities.
